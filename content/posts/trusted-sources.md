# The problem

In a world of AI slop, and mis-information campaigns. In a world where Google Search was intentionally sabotaged for ad revenue, and enshittification is the name of the game, it's hard to know where to get good quality information.

# The solution

I don't pretend to have a good solution, yet. However, these are sources of information that I *currently* trust. By no means is this an exhaustive list, it's meant to be frequently updated and annotated.

Trust should be earned, and so to get on the list, I have to vet the sources and be aware of their biases and blindspots first. Only then can I add them to the list. The list is categorized and every entry has a reason I've put my trust in them. 

The list is centred around my interests. Make your own if you're not satisfied

# The list

## Software Development

- [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com "The orange site"): Hackernews is a aggregation site where people, through some presumably flawed process, decide what ends up on the front page. Given that this is just tech news, this is enough for me.

- [Lobsters](https://www.lobste.rs "Computing-focused community aggregation site"): Very similar to hackernews, not as popular, and, IMHO stricter.

- [WebPerf.tips](https://webperf.tips/ "A website about web performance tips"): A website with a blog about web performance tips

## Philosophy

- [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/ "Stanford's Encyclopedia of Philosophy"): Stanford's Encyclopedia of Philosophy is a fantastic resource for background information into a topic in Philosophy. It's been quite useful to me.

## Agriculture

- [Backyard Gardener by The University of Arizona](https://cales.arizona.edu/yavapai/anr/hort/byg/index.html "The Backyard Gardener was a weekly newspaper column written by University of Arizona Extension Agent Emeritus, Jeff Schalau.")
