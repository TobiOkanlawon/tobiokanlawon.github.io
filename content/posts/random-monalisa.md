Does randomness qualify as art?

No, it's really simple. Consider this.

The irrational number *pi* is infinite and its digits do not repeat. In it is contained a representation of every pattern, every word, every piece of music, every whisper, and--so long as it can be digitized--every thing.

Or If that's too arcane, imagine that I have a program that generates truly random numbers and I run this program on a computer, and I hook up this computer to an energy source that lasts forever. This simulates *pi*, theoretically.

Now, we can imagine that, in that infinite vastness of randomness and unintelligibility, a particular string of numbers will, when converted to an image, perfectly represent the Monalisa. Pixel for pixel.

Is this art?
